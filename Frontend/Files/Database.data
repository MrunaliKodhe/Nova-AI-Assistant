Mrunali Kodhe: Hai nova give a poem about environment.
Nova: Here's a short poem about the environment:
"Earth's whispers echo through the trees,
A fragile balance, we must seize.
Rivers dry, and skies turn gray,
Consequences of our actions each day.
Let's cherish nature, pure and kind,
Preserve the beauty, left behind.
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, it's our part,
Save the planet, heal the heart.
In harmony, we must strive,
With nature's rhythm, we must thrive.
For a brighter tomorrow, we must try,
To protect the earth, before we say goodbye."
